## Why WhoIsParking Exists 💡

WhoIsParking was created to solve a simple but frustrating real-world problem.

In my dad’s apartment building, visitors were required to register their vehicles on a paper list at the main entrance. You had to physically go downstairs, write your name, car details, and arrival time and remember to do it every time.

One day, I forgot to register my car. Coincidentally, the homeowner was present and asked everyone if they knew who the car belonged to. That moment sparked the idea: why is this still done on paper?

A digital system would:

- Allow visitors to register their vehicle from anywhere

- Make it easy to register after arrival

- Eliminate lost or incomplete paper lists

- Improve transparency for homeowners and residents


WhoIsParking aims to modernize this process with a simple, digital solution.
